Hey Allison! 

I am looking forward to touch base with you at our meeting. 
I've attached the materials needed for the discussion.
As you can see we are planning to implement the design changes ASAP for marketing.
Management has considered this a win-win situation and invites us all to 'think outside of the box'!
They also hope we can streamline production in a method that reflects a positive ROI.  

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Regards, Clifford Marcus
